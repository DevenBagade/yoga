Description of Boat Pose (Navasana):

Boat Pose, also known as Navasana in Sanskrit, is a yoga asana that strengthens the core muscles while improving balance and concentration. In this pose, the body resembles the shape of a boat, hence the name. It is a seated posture that requires engagement of the abdominal muscles, hip flexors, and back muscles.
<br>
Steps to Perform Boat Pose:
<br>
Starting Position: Begin by sitting on the floor with your legs extended in front of you and your hands resting beside your hips.

Engage Core: Sit up tall, lengthening your spine, and engage your abdominal muscles.

Lift the Legs: As you inhale, lean back slightly and lift your legs off the floor. Keep your knees straight initially, forming a V-shape with your torso.

Extend Arms: Extend your arms forward parallel to the ground, palms facing each other. Your arms should be in line with your shoulders.

Balance: Find your balance by keeping your chest lifted and your spine straight. Avoid rounding your back.

Hold the Pose: Hold the pose for 10-30 seconds or as long as you can maintain proper form and breath control.

Release: Exhale as you gently lower your legs and torso back to the starting position. Rest for a moment before repeating the pose if desired.
<br>
Benefits of Boat Pose:
<br>
Strengthens Core Muscles: Boat Pose primarily targets the abdominal muscles, including the rectus abdominis, obliques, and transverse abdominis, helping to build core strength and stability.

Improves Digestion: The compression of the abdominal area in Boat Pose stimulates the digestive organs, aiding in digestion and relieving digestive issues such as bloating and constipation.

Enhances Balance and Stability: Balancing in Boat Pose challenges the muscles of the core and lower back, improving overall balance and stability.

Stimulates Kidneys and Thyroid: The pressure applied to the abdomen in this pose can help stimulate the kidneys and thyroid gland, promoting better functioning of these vital organs.

Tones Leg Muscles: Holding the legs up in Boat Pose engages the quadriceps and hip flexors, toning and strengthening the muscles of the legs.

Improves Focus and Concentration: Maintaining balance in Boat Pose requires concentration and focus, helping to calm the mind and improve mental clarity.</p>
