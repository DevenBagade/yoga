        <p><br>Description<br>
Bhujangasana, also known as Cobra Pose, is a rejuvenating yoga posture that holds a significant place in the realm of Hatha Yoga. Its name is derived from the Sanskrit words "bhujanga," meaning serpent or snake, and "asana," meaning pose. Just as a cobra gracefully raises its hood, this asana involves arching the upper body, resembling the posture of a cobra about to strike. It is considered a fundamental backbend pose, often incorporated into various yoga sequences for its multitude of benefits.
<br>
Steps to Perform Bhujangasana:
<br>
Preparation: Lie flat on your stomach (prone position) on a comfortable yoga mat. Ensure your feet are together, with the tops of your feet pressing into the ground. Place your palms on the floor, slightly below your shoulders, and keep your elbows close to your body.

Inhale and Lift: As you inhale deeply, gently lift your chest off the ground by straightening your arms. Keep your pubic bone rooted to the floor and engage your legs. Ensure your elbows remain slightly bent, allowing for a smooth transition into the pose.

Elongate the Neck: Lift your gaze upward, directing your vision towards the ceiling or sky. Avoid straining your neck; instead, maintain a comfortable stretch.

Shoulder Alignment: Roll your shoulder blades back and down, broadening your chest. This action not only deepens the stretch but also helps in maintaining proper alignment.

Breathe: Hold the pose for a few breaths, maintaining a steady rhythm of deep inhales and exhales. Feel the expansion of your chest with each breath.

Release: Exhale slowly as you lower your chest back to the ground, returning to the starting position. Relax your body completely, allowing yourself to rest for a moment.

Repeat: You can repeat Bhujangasana for a few rounds, gradually increasing the duration and depth of the stretch as your body becomes more accustomed to the pose.

Benefits of Bhujangasana:
<br>
Strengthens the Spine: Bhujangasana enhances spinal flexibility and strengthens the muscles along the spine, promoting a healthy and resilient back.

Improves Posture: Regular practice of Cobra Pose helps correct rounded shoulders and counteracts the effects of prolonged sitting, thereby improving overall posture.

Stimulates Abdominal Organs: The gentle compression of the abdomen in this pose massages the digestive organs, promoting digestion and alleviating digestive issues.

Opens the Heart Center: As the chest expands in Bhujangasana, it opens up the heart center, fostering feelings of positivity, confidence, and emotional balance.

Relieves Stress and Fatigue: The controlled breathing and gentle backbend of Cobra Pose help alleviate stress, anxiety, and fatigue, leaving you feeling rejuvenated and energized.

Enhances Respiratory Function: This pose expands the chest and encourages deep breathing, improving lung capacity and respiratory efficiency.

Stimulates Circulation: By stretching and strengthening the muscles and tissues, Bhujangasana enhances blood circulation throughout the body, promoting overall health and vitality.
