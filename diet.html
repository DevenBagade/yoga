        <h2>Hydration for Moms</h2>
        <p>Proper hydration is crucial for moms to maintain energy levels, support milk production if breastfeeding, and promote overall health. Here are some hydration tips for moms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Drink Water Regularly:</strong> Aim to drink water throughout the day, keeping a water bottle handy to stay hydrated.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor Urine Color:</strong> Check the color of your urine; pale yellow or clear urine indicates adequate hydration, while dark yellow urine may indicate dehydration.</li>
            <li><strong>Hydrating Foods:</strong> Consume hydrating foods such as fruits (e.g., watermelon, strawberries) and vegetables (e.g., cucumber, spinach) to increase fluid intake.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Excessive Caffeine:</strong> Limit caffeinated beverages as they can have diuretic effects and contribute to dehydration.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Workout Hydration:</strong> Replenish fluids after exercise or physical activity, especially if breastfeeding, to prevent dehydration.</li>
        </ul>
