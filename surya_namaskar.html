<br>Description<br>

Surya Namaskar, also known as Sun Salutation, is a sequence of yoga postures that are traditionally performed in the early morning to greet the sun and energize the body. This ancient practice holds immense significance in yoga and is revered for its numerous physical, mental, and spiritual benefits. Let's delve into the steps and benefits of Surya Namaskar.

<br>
Steps of Surya Namaskar:
<br>

Pranamasana (Prayer Pose): Stand at the front of your mat with feet together. Bring your palms together in front of your chest in a prayer position, and close your eyes. This is the starting position.

Hasta Uttanasana (Raised Arms Pose): Inhale deeply and lift your arms upward while arching your back gently. Push your hips slightly forward. Keep your biceps close to your ears and gaze at your hands.

Hasta Padasana (Hand to Foot Pose): Exhale and bend forward from the waist while keeping your spine erect. Bring your hands down to touch the floor beside your feet. You can bend your knees if needed.

Ashwa Sanchalanasana (Equestrian Pose): Inhale and step your right leg back, placing the knee on the floor. Keep your left knee bent and gaze forward. Ensure your right foot is flat on the ground.

Dandasana (Stick Pose): As you exhale, bring your left leg back to align with your right leg. Keep your body in a straight line, forming a plank position. Engage your core muscles and keep your elbows close to your body.

Ashtanga Namaskara (Salute with Eight Parts): Gently lower your knees, chest, and chin to the floor while keeping your hips raised. Eight parts of your body touch the floor: chin, chest, palms, knees, and toes.

Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose): Inhale and slide forward, raising your chest and head off the floor. Keep your elbows bent and shoulders away from your ears. Look upward and feel a gentle stretch in your spine.

Parvatasana (Mountain Pose): Exhale and lift your hips upward, forming an inverted V shape. Straighten your arms and legs, pressing your heels towards the floor. Keep your head between your arms.

Ashwa Sanchalanasana (Equestrian Pose): Inhale and step your right foot forward between your hands. Keep your left knee on the floor, and gaze forward.

Hasta Padasana (Hand to Foot Pose): Exhale and bring your left foot forward to meet your right foot. Keep your palms on the floor beside your feet.

Hasta Uttanasana (Raised Arms Pose): Inhale and slowly raise your arms upward, arching your back gently. Push your hips slightly forward and gaze at your hands.

Pranamasana (Prayer Pose): Exhale and bring your palms together in front of your chest. Stand tall in a prayer position, with your eyes closed. This completes one round of Surya Namaskar.
