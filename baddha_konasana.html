<br>Description<br>

Baddha Konasana, commonly known as Bound Angle Pose or Butterfly Pose, is a seated yoga posture that is deeply beneficial for both the body and the mind. This asana is widely practiced in various yoga traditions due to its ability to stretch the inner thighs, groins, and knees while simultaneously calming the mind and relieving stress.


<br>

Steps to Practice Baddha Konasana (Bound Angle Pose):
<br>
Starting Position: Begin by sitting on the floor with your legs extended straight out in front of you.

Bend the Knees: Bend your knees and bring the soles of your feet together, allowing your knees to fall open to the sides.

Join the Feet: Grasp your feet with your hands. You can hold the big toes with your first two fingers and thumbs, or you can interlace your fingers around your feet.

Lengthen the Spine: Sit up tall with a straight spine. Engage your core muscles to support your back.

Open the Chest: Roll your shoulders back and down, opening your chest. Avoid slouching forward.

Flap the Knees: If comfortable, gently flap your knees up and down like the wings of a butterfly. This movement can help release tension in the hips and groin.

Hold the Pose: Hold the pose for 30 seconds to 1 minute, breathing deeply and evenly.

Release: To come out of the pose, release your feet and extend your legs forward.

Benefits of Baddha Konasana:
<br>
Stretches Inner Thighs and Groins: Baddha Konasana provides a deep stretch to the inner thighs and groins, improving flexibility in these areas.

Opens the Hips: This asana helps to open up the hip joints, which can be especially beneficial for individuals who sit for long periods or those with tight hips.

Stimulates Abdominal Organs: The pose stimulates the abdominal organs, including the ovaries and prostate gland, which can help improve digestion and reproductive health.

Relieves Menstrual Discomfort: Practicing Baddha Konasana regularly can help alleviate menstrual discomfort and symptoms of menopause by increasing blood flow to the pelvic area.

Calms the Mind: The gentle stretching and focus on breath in Baddha Konasana help to calm the mind, reduce stress, and promote relaxation.

Improves Posture: Regular practice of this asana helps to improve posture by strengthening the muscles of the back and core.

Prepares for Childbirth: Baddha Konasana can be beneficial for pregnant women as it helps to open the pelvic area, preparing the body for childbirth.

Therapeutic for Sciatica: This pose can provide relief from sciatic pain by stretching the muscles and nerves of the lower back and hips.
