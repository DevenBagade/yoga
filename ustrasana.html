        <p><br>Description<br>Ustrasana, also known as Camel Pose, is a rejuvenating yoga posture that offers numerous physical and mental benefits. This asana is named after the camel because it imitates the posture of a camel's hump, with the spine arching backward. Ustrasana is a backbend that stretches the entire front of the body, including the chest, abdomen, and thighs, while also strengthening the back muscles.
<br>
Steps to Perform Ustrasana (Camel Pose):
<br>
Start in a Kneeling Position: Begin by kneeling on the yoga mat with your knees hip-width apart. Ensure that your thighs are perpendicular to the floor and that the tops of your feet are pressing into the mat.

Place Your Hands on Your Lower Back: Reach your hands backward and place them on your lower back, with your fingers pointing downwards. Keep your palms pressing against your lower back to provide support as you move into the backbend.

Engage Your Core: Draw your tailbone down towards the floor and engage your core muscles to support your lower back.

Inhale and Lift Your Chest: As you inhale, gently begin to arch your back, allowing your chest to lift upwards towards the ceiling. Keep your chin slightly tucked to maintain length in the back of your neck.

Reach Backwards with Your Hands: If you feel comfortable, reach your hands one at a time towards your heels. Only go as far as feels comfortable for your body, and avoid straining or forcing the movement.

Hold the Pose: Hold the posture for 20-30 seconds, breathing deeply and maintaining the arch in your back.

Release the Pose: To come out of the pose, slowly bring your hands back to your lower back, and then gently lower your hips back down towards your heels. Take a moment to rest in Child's Pose before moving on to the next posture.

Benefits of Ustrasana:
<br>
Improves Posture: Ustrasana helps to open up the chest and shoulders, counteracting the rounded posture that can result from sitting at a desk or computer for extended periods.

Stretches the Front Body: This pose stretches the entire front of the body, including the chest, abdomen, and hip flexors, helping to alleviate tightness and tension.

Strengthens the Back: While Ustrasana is primarily a backbend, it also strengthens the muscles along the spine, improving spinal flexibility and stability.

Stimulates Digestion: The compression of the abdomen in Ustrasana can help to stimulate digestion and relieve digestive discomfort.

Elevates Mood: Backbends are known for their energizing and mood-lifting effects. Ustrasana opens the heart center, promoting feelings of positivity and well-being.

Increases Lung Capacity: The expansive chest opening in Ustrasana allows for deeper breathing, improving lung capacity and oxygenation of the body.   </p>
