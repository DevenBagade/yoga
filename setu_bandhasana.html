<br> Description <br>
Setu Bandhasana, also known as Bridge Pose, is a fundamental yoga asana that offers a plethora of physical and mental benefits. Derived from the Sanskrit words "Setu," meaning bridge, and "Bandha," meaning lock, this pose aims to create a bridge-like shape with the body. It is commonly practiced in yoga classes worldwide due to its accessibility and effectiveness in improving overall health and well-being.
<br>
Steps to Practice Setu Bandhasana:
<br>
Preparation:

Begin by lying on your back (supine position) on a yoga mat. Keep your arms by your sides, palms facing down.
Bend your knees, keeping your feet flat on the mat hip-width apart. Ensure your ankles are directly under your knees.
Lifting the Hips:

As you inhale, press your feet firmly into the mat, activating your thighs and buttocks.
Exhale and slowly lift your hips off the ground, rolling your spine off the floor one vertebra at a time.
Keep your shoulders grounded and draw your shoulder blades toward each other to support your lift.
Engage your core muscles to maintain stability and support your lower back.
Creating the Bridge:

Continue lifting your hips until your thighs are parallel to the floor, forming a straight line from your knees to your shoulders.
Interlace your fingers beneath your back and press your arms and shoulders into the mat to lift your chest slightly higher.
Keep your chin slightly tucked to maintain a neutral neck position. Avoid compressing the back of your neck.
Hold and Breathe:

Hold the pose for 30 seconds to 1 minute, breathing deeply and evenly.
Focus on elongating your spine and opening your chest with each inhale, and relaxing any tension in your body with each exhale.
Release:

To release the pose, slowly unclasp your hands and lower your spine back down to the mat one vertebra at a time.
Allow your hips to gently rest on the ground, returning to the starting position.

Benefits of Setu Bandhasana:<br>
Strengthens the Back: Setu Bandhasana strengthens the muscles of the back, including the erector spinae and gluteus muscles, helping to alleviate back pain and improve posture.

Stretches the Chest: By opening up the chest and shoulders, this pose counteracts the effects of hunching over a desk or computer, promoting better breathing and lung capacity.

Improves Spinal Flexibility: Practicing Bridge Pose regularly helps to increase spinal flexibility and mobility, reducing stiffness and tension in the spine.

Stimulates the Thyroid Gland: The gentle compression of the throat in Setu Bandhasana stimulates the thyroid gland, which can help regulate metabolism and energy levels.

Relieves Stress and Anxiety: This pose calms the mind and nervous system, promoting relaxation and reducing stress and anxiety.

Improves Digestion: Setu Bandhasana massages the abdominal organs, improving digestion and alleviating symptoms of indigestion and bloating.

Enhances Blood Circulation: The inverted nature of Bridge Pose encourages blood flow to the brain and heart, improving circulation throughout the body.

Develops Balance and Stability: Holding the pose requires balance and stability, strengthening the core and improving overall body awareness.
